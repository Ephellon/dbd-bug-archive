<!-- summary -->
## AI TL;DR

The Knight joins the roster with three new perks—Nowhere to Hide, Hex: Face the Darkness, and Hubris—while Vittorio Toscano debuts as a survivor, bringing Potential Energy, Fogwise, and Quick Gambit. The Shattered Square arrives as the latest map, and the existing Basement receives wider stairs and visual tweaks to pallets and doors. Flashlight mechanics are adjusted so late-stage blinds now stun the killer, and PS5 gains haptic feedback. Hosts can now add survivor bots to custom matches.

The update also refines guard behavior, rebalances several add-ons and perk timers, and addresses numerous bugs—including animation stalls, aura visibility, map clipping, tutorial steps, and flashlight blind timing—across all platforms.

# 6.4.0 | Forged in Fog

![1920x1080_PN.png](../../images/4dfb07f1060024e8-1920x1080-pn.png)

## Features

- New Killer - The Knight
  - New Perk - Nowhere to Hide
    - Whenever you damage a generator, reveal the aura of all survivors standing within 24 meters of your position for 3/4/5 seconds.
  - New Perk - Hex: Face the Darkness
    - Injuring a Survivor by any means lights a Dull Totem, activating the Hex. While the Hex is active, all other Survivors outside of your Terror Radius will scream every 35/30/25 seconds, revealing their positions and auras for 2 seconds. When the Survivor enters the dying state or becomes healthy, the Hex totem becomes dull again and this perk deactivates. If the Hex totem is cleansed, this perk is permanently disabled.
  - New Perk - Hubris
    - Whenever you are stunned by a Survivor, that Survivor suffers from the Exposed status effect for 10/15/20 seconds. Hubris has a cooldown of 20 seconds.
- New Survivor - Vittorio Toscano
  - New Perk - Potential Energy
    - After working on a generator for 12/10/8 uninterrupted seconds, press the Active Ability Button 2 to activate this perk. When this perk is active, repairing the generator will charge this perk instead of making the generator progress. For each 1.5% of generator repair, the perk will gain one token, up to 20 tokens. While this perk has at least one token and you are working on a generator, you can press the Active Ability Button 2 to consume all the tokens and instantly make the generator progress by 1% for each token. This perk then deactivates. If you lose a health state while this perk has at least 1 tokens, the perk will lose all tokens and deactivate. Missing a skill check will also result in some charges lost.
  - New Perk - Fogwise
    - Hitting a great Skill Check while repairing a generator reveals the aura of the Killer to you for 4/5/6 seconds.
  - New Perk - Quick Gambit
    - When you are chased within 24 meters of any generator, any other Survivor working on that generator receives a 6/7/8% speed boost to the repair action.
- Flashlight update
  - Flashlight blinds that occur within the last 0.4 seconds of the Survivor pickup animation will now stun the Killer once the animation has completed.
    - ***Dev note**: We've increased the duration of the buffer from its PTB value of 0.25 to account for latency.*
  - Killers are now immune to blindness while grabbing a Survivor out of a locker.
- Bots in Custom Matches
  - The host of a Custom Match can add Survivor bots to the game.
- (PS5 Only!) Added Haptic Feedback & a pop-up informing players.
- Rancor Perk - updated the conditions on which the obsession becomes exposed to include closing the hatch
